# BioScale — Free OKOK·International Alternative for Body Composition

> **Open-source, ad-free, fully offline body composition analyzer for BLE smart scales (Chipsea chipset). A free alternative to the [OKOK·International](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/okok-international/id1028294311) app.**

## Why BioScale?

The **[OKOK·International](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chipsea.btcontrol.en)** app (by Chipsea / [okokapp.com](https://okokapp.com)) is filled with ads, locks key features behind a paywall, and uses **inaccurate bioimpedance calculations**. BioScale was built as a **completely free, open-source alternative** that fixes all of that:

- **No ads, no login, no paywall** — all features unlocked from day one
- **100% offline** — your data never leaves your computer
- **Accurate BIA calculations** — formulas derived from reverse-engineering the OKOK CsAlgoBuilder plus validated scientific references (Janssen 2000, Mifflin-St Jeor, Kyle 2004, EWGSOP2)
- **20+ body composition metrics** — more than the OKOK·International app offers, even in its paid version
- **Cross-platform** — runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux
- **Open source** — audit the code, contribute, or fork it

## Features

### Dashboard
- Real-time weight display with BMI classification bar
- Weight goal tracking with progress indicator
- Quick access to History, Composition, and Settings
- Personalized greeting and weight change from previous measurement

### Body Composition (20+ metrics)
- **General:** Body Score, BMI, Obesity Degree, Ideal Weight, Metabolic Age
- **Fat:** Body Fat %, Fat Mass (kg), Visceral Fat Index, Subcutaneous Fat
- **Muscle:** Muscle Mass (% and kg), Skeletal Muscle Mass (SMM), FFMI, SMI, LBM, Bone Mass
- **Other:** Body Water (% and kg), Protein %, Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)
- **Tier 2 (optional):** Waist-to-Hip Ratio (WHR), Waist-to-Height Ratio (WHtR), Cardiovascular Risk Score

### History & Comparison
- Full measurement history with timeline
- Side-by-side comparison between any two measurements
- Track your progress over time

### Data Management
- Export data as CSV
- SQLite database backup
- Clear history
- Full data deletion (privacy-first)

### BLE Scale Communication
- Native BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) connection via `bleak`
- Supports Chipsea V1 (FFF0→FFF4) and V2 (FFB0→FFB2/FFB3) protocols
- Auto-scan and connect to compatible scales
- Mock mode for testing without a physical scale

## Compatible Scales

BioScale works with smart scales using the **Chipsea chipset**, which is common in many affordable BLE body composition scales sold under brands like:

- Scales that use the OKOK·International app
- Generic Bluetooth body fat scales (AliExpress, Amazon, Shopee)
- Any scale advertising compatibility with "OKOK", "OKOK·International", or "Chipsea"

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- Bluetooth adapter (built-in or USB dongle)

### Quick Start (macOS / Linux)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/brumathey/bioscale-okok-alternative.git
cd bioscale-okok-alternative

# Option 1: Use the install script
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh

# Option 2: Manual setup
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
python main.py
# or use the start script:
./start.sh
```

### Quick Start (Windows)

```cmd
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/brumathey/bioscale-okok-alternative.git
cd bioscale-okok-alternative

# Option 1: Double-click install.bat, then start.bat

# Option 2: Manual setup
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

The dashboard opens automatically at `http://localhost:8050`.

### Bluetooth Permission (macOS)

Your terminal app (Terminal, iTerm2, VS Code) needs Bluetooth permission:

**System Settings → Privacy & Security → Bluetooth** → Enable toggle for your terminal.

### Other Commands

```bash
# Scan for compatible BLE scales nearby
python main.py --scan

# Run in mock mode (no physical scale needed)
USE_MOCK_BLE=1 python main.py

# Debug mode
python main.py --debug
```
